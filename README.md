# Fast Enhancement of JPEG Compressed Noisy Document Images using Deep Learning

---
## Abstract :

The two most important restoration processes in
the computer vision image processing task are denoising and
deblurring of pictures. They have to be done before any other
operation like text detection and OCR scanning. If a restoration
operation is not done properly, then the output will be wrong
and cannot be used in any way by the user. As the use of digital
devices has grown, the majority of data is now created and shared
in compressed form. On many devices, JPEG compression is the
default setting. Directly recovering a picture in the compressed
domain is an intriguing research problem in terms of storage
and computing costs.
This paper introduces a generic method for Residual network
learning and inference in the JPEG transform domain, enabling
the network to take compressed pictures as input. In this method,
we constructed and trained the model on a benchmark dataset,
which turned out to work rationally well. We produce a result
that is mathematically equal to a spatial domain network.We
demonstrate that skipping the laborious decompression stage
enables quicker image processing with minimal to no network
accuracy loss.
The experimental results showed cutting-edge performance in
both compressed and uncompressed domains.
